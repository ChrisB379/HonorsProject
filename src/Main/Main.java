//TODO Align all text boxes in GUIs to be in the same place to prevent the buttons from moving around
//TODO Align each tutorial. Going from 1 to 2 the windows are different size and the buttons do not line up
//TODO move the example tags to the left as it looks odd being in the middle of their panel but in the frame they are about 1/3rd in
//TODO Change work after interactivity
//TODO Add a merge sort set of panels after work after, similar to memoization
//TODO link the new abstract class to the GUIs to get the value of n on each call so it is displayed
//TODO find more common methods to use between each algorithm class in the model
//TODO possibly a new method to get and set any variables used in the model e.g in factorial get the value of each return on the recursive calls to store for use in the GUI to compare with the users answer
//TODO Is parameters the right thing to do? Is it do able? If not then hard code each possible and display them that way?
//TODO figure out how to auto generate the factorial examples text boxes. Is hard code the best way?
//TODO change the example screen or add a new one to specific that this is the last recursive call before the base case and so ask the user what they think the final value will be. Make it clear that its the final call
//TODO have a section on iteration v recursion, when to use them, advantages of one over the other etc
//TODO move the counters in the advance buttons so that the algorithm page can loop as much as needed
//TODO add text to the example classes which states the parameter input must be between 1 and 10
//TODO change input validation on parameters to be > 0 < 11 and not whatever number is used in the example page
//TODO format the JTextField in the algorithm classes. Only textfields can have listeners but the layout is poor
//TODO set arraylists to clear once tutorials are finished e.g in ReturnValueAlgorithm combined with the SubmitController, it doesnt seem to happen since a new instance is made each time however
//TODO rename factorial algorithm to fact for the sake of ReturnValueAlgorithm2 class
//TODO set the parameter fields to all check for if the input .equals("") and if so then make a dialog box. If not then accent the input. This fixes the issue of focus listeners
