It prevents infinite loops and crashes due to stack overflow errors. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\tConvergence is an important term relating to the base case. Each recursive call must converge towards the base case to ensure it is eventually met or the same errors mentioned above can occur.\r\n<br>\r\n<br><b>Tutorial 2: Return Values</b>\r\n<br>\tReturn values for a recursive method is calculated after the base case has been met. Until that point, each value is remembered from each recursive call before a final calculation or algorithm is done once the base case has been met.\r\n<br>\r\n<br><b>Tutorial 3: Excessive Recomputation</b>\r\n<br>\tExcessive recomputation is when a recursive call recalculates a sum or algorithm which has already been calculated previously. By not saving results of recursive calls, CPU time and resources are wasted by recalculating sums/algorithms.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\tMemoization is a method to solve this, by storing results and calculations of recursive calls which can then be checked on each call to ensure it has not already been calculated before. If it has then it is just a matter of fetching the answer from whatever data structure it was stored in.\r\n<br>\r\n<br><b>Tutorial 4: Work after</b>\r\n<br>\tWork after the recursive call shows that a method does not have to return and end once the base case of a recursive call has been met. More work can be done after the recursive call has been compelted.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\tA good series of examples for this is searches and sorts. Particularly merge sort.\r\n<br>\r\n<br> Now that you have compelted the tutorial series it is recommended that you proceed to the end of series quiz to test your new found knowledge.");
