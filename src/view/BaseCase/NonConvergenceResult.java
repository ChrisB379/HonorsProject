It also prevents the recursive call falling into an infinite loop and thus creating a stack overflow, crashing any programing running the recursive call.\r\n\r\nWithin the topic of bases, the idea of convergence was presented. Convergence plays an important part in bases cases, in that each recursive call must ensure that any variables being incremented/decremented should converge(get closer to) the base case. If this fails to happen then similar to what happens if there is no base case, the program can crash in an infinite loop which causes a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of tutortial series 1.");
